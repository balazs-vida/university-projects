This repository contains some of my university assignments that have a coding part to them. 

## [Design and analysis of algorithms 2](http://ewkiss.web.elte.hu/html/ujbsc/english/BSc/at5a_en.html)

The goal of this assignment was to provide a short but substantive introduction to backtracking. The example problem was LeetCode's [Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/).

## [Numerical analysis 2](http://ewkiss.web.elte.hu/html/ujbsc/english/BSc/na5a_en.html)

In this assignment I implemented an adaptive third-order Runge--Kutta formula with an embedded second-order method (cf. the Bogacki--Shampine method) to solve first-order differential equations with initial conditions.

## [Symbolic mathematical programs](http://ewkiss.web.elte.hu/html/ujbsc/english/BSc/sp3m_3a_en.html)

Implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm, a random walk and the MC estimation of pi in SageMath.
